  <h2><span>Subway Moto</span></h2>
  <p><span><strong>Subway Moto</strong> throws you straight onto high-speed subway rails carved through massive mountains and dark tunnels. The ground shakes, the trains roar past, and danger is only a split-second away. Your mission is simple: survive as long as possible while dodging trains, leaping barriers, and racing through chaotic 3D tracks. If you hesitate, you crash — but if you react fast, you rise as a legend.</span></p>
  <p><img src="/images/games/game13-01.webp" alt="Subway Moto rider dodging obstacles on subway rails" width="50%" style="width: 50%;"></p>

  <h3><span>About Subway Moto</span></h3>
  <p><span><strong>Subway Moto</strong> is a survival-based driving game where precision and lightning reflexes determine your fate. Your bike speeds forward automatically across broken rails, twisting tunnels, and elevated subway paths. Trains rush from both directions, barriers pop up unexpectedly, and coins line the rails waiting to be collected. With each meter traveled, the intensity rises and the obstacles evolve, keeping every run unpredictable and thrilling.</span></p>

  <h3><span>Gameplay: Survival on Wheels</span></h3>
  <p><span>In <strong>Subway Moto</strong>, the bike moves automatically — your job is to make micro-decisions at high speed. Shift lanes to dodge incoming trains, leap over rail barricades, or slide across sharp curves carved into cliffsides. The deeper you ride into the mountain subway system, the tougher the patterns become. Every second invites chaos, and every near-miss brings adrenaline.</span></p>

  <h3><span>How to Play</span></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span><strong>Move Left/Right:</strong> Use the <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> or <strong>A/D</strong> to dodge trains and switch lanes.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Jump:</strong> Use the <strong>W</strong> key or <strong>Up Arrow</strong> to leap over barriers and broken tracks.</span></li>
    <li><span><strong>Collect Coins:</strong> Grab coins to unlock faster, more stable bikes.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h3><span>Game Highlights</span></h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Subway-Themed Chaos:</strong><span> Trains, barriers, sudden drops, and nonstop near-misses keep the tension high.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Cinematic Environments:</strong><span> Race through mountain cliffs, tunnels, rail bridges, and nighttime subway paths.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Fast Reflex Gameplay:</strong><span> Only sharp reaction time keeps you alive as obstacles spawn unexpectedly.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Endless Replay Value:</strong><span> Randomized obstacle patterns ensure each run feels fresh and challenging.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Upgradeable Bikes:</strong><span> Unlock stronger bikes with better stability and speed to extend your survival runs.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h3><span>Tips and Strategies</span></h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Stay Centered:</strong><span> Keep your bike in the middle lane when possible — it gives more reaction options.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Learn Train Patterns:</strong><span> Trains signal slightly before appearing; use those clues to dodge early.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Jump Smart:</strong><span> Only jump when necessary — mistimed jumps may land you directly into obstacles.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Collect Coins Efficiently:</strong><span> Aim for coin clusters on safe paths rather than risky single coins.</span></li>
    <li><strong>Upgrade Regularly:</strong><span> Stronger bikes give you smoother control and better lane-switching precision.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h3><span>FAQ</span></h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>What is Subway Moto?</strong><br><span>It’s a fast-paced 3D subway survival game where you dodge trains, barriers, and broken tracks while racing for the longest distance.</span></li>

  <h3><span>About Fury Chase 2</span></h3>
  <p><span><strong>Fury Chase 2</strong> takes place in an unforgiving desert world filled with scavengers, war convoys, and armored rigs.

  <h3><span>Gameplay: Nonstop Pursuit in a World Without Mercy</span></h3>

Enemies arrive from all angles, forcing you to maneuver aggressively while firing back with everything your ride has. Advanced vehicles introduce mechanics like shockwave rams, oil slick traps, and flamethrower bursts.

    <h2><span>Angry Mario</span></h2>

Get ready for a hilarious and explosive twist on classic gameplay where strategy meets chaos!</span></p>
    <p><img src="/images/games/game10-01.webp" alt="Angry Mario gameplay" width="50%" style="width: 50%;" /></p>
  
    <h3><span>About Angry Mario</span></h3>
    <p><span><strong>Angry Mario</strong> is a physics-based puzzle and shooting game that takes inspiration from the beloved <em>Angry Birds</em> series, reimagined in the <strong>Mushroom Kingdom</strong>. Each level presents a new architectural challenge — wooden blocks, stone towers, and mischievous monsters hiding within. Your goal: launch Mario with precise aim and power to destroy everything in your path. Every shot counts, so plan carefully and unleash maximum destruction!</span></p>
  
    <h3><span>Gameplay: Launch Fireballs and Destroy Monsters</span></h3>
    <p><span>In <strong>Angry Mario</strong>, players take control of Mario as he transforms into a fiery projectile. Your objective is to eliminate all enemies by destroying the structures that protect them. Each level challenges your understanding of physics, requiring you to adjust both <strong>angle</strong> and <strong>launch power</strong> to hit weak points effectively. The fewer shots you use, the higher your score — but beware, every miss costs you valuable attempts!</span></p>
  
    <h3><span>Explore the Attractive Features</span></h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Unique Gameplay Fusion:</strong><span> A perfect mix of <em>Angry Birds</em> mechanics with the <em>Mario universe</em> — combining precision shooting and creative destruction.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Fireball Launch Mechanics:</strong><span> Launch Mario as a blazing fireball that smashes through blocks, bricks, and enemy fortresses.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Progressive Challenge System:</strong><span> Levels get harder as you advance — requiring sharper calculations and better strategy to clear.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Two Difficulty Modes:</strong><span> Choose between <em>Easy</em> and <em>Hard</em> modes to match your skill level, from casual fun to pro-level precision puzzles.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Vivid Mario World Design:</strong><span> Enjoy bright visuals and familiar enemies from Mario’s world, now turned into puzzle targets waiting to be blasted away!</span></li>
    </ol>
  
    <h3><span>How to Play</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span>Click and hold the <strong>mouse button</strong> on Mario’s position.</span></li>
      <li><span>Drag the cursor in the <strong>opposite direction</strong> you want Mario to fly.</span></li>
      <li><span>Adjust the <strong>angle</strong> and <strong>power</strong> of your shot based on the target’s structure.</span></li>
      <li><span>Release the mouse button to launch Mario as a fiery projectile and watch the destruction unfold!</span></li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3><span>Tips and Strategies</span></h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Plan Before You Shoot:</strong><span> Observe the enemy’s structure first — aim for weak points that can cause maximum chain reactions.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Use the Right Force:</strong><span> Too much power can send Mario flying past the target, while too little won’t break tough blocks.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Save Shots for Bonus Points:</strong><span> Complete levels using fewer shots to earn higher scores and unlock hidden rewards.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Practice Angles:</strong><span> Small adjustments in launch direction can drastically change the outcome — mastering angles is key!</span></li>
      <li><strong>Replay for Perfection:</strong><span> Each level can be replayed to improve your star rating and uncover alternate destruction paths.</span></li>
    </ol>
  
    <h3><span>FAQ</span></h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>What makes Angry Mario different from Angry Birds?</strong><br><span>While both share physics-based mechanics, <strong>Angry Mario</strong> features familiar Mario enemies, themed worlds, and the fireball twist, giving it a unique identity.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Are there different worlds or stages?</strong><br><span>Yes, the game includes multiple themed worlds inspired by Mario’s adventures, each featuring its own environmental mechanics and challenges.</span></li>
      <li><strong>Can I unlock new abilities?</strong><br><span>As you progress, you can access new power-ups like <em>Explosive Mario</em> and <em>Ice Mario</em> for special destructive effects.</span></li>
      <li><strong>What happens if I run out of shots?</strong><br><span>If you fail to destroy all enemies within your limited shots, you’ll need to restart the level — but each retry helps you refine your strategy!</span></li>
      <li><strong>Is Angry Mario suitable for kids?</strong><br><span>Absolutely! The game combines fun visuals and simple mechanics, making it suitable for all ages while still offering depth for puzzle fans.</span></li>

With randomized courses and a host of new features, Slope 2 takes the classic endless runner formula to a whole new level of excitement.</p>

  <h3>What Makes Slope 2 Different?</h3>
